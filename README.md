# 🏰 A price tracker for products from Amazon, Mercado Livre and Magazine Luiza 🏰

*"It's just a web scraper"*
<br>- some douchebag

Welcome! Welcome to my price tracking system. This isn't your average, run-of-the-mill price tracker — oh no! No, this has some *pizazz*, man.

## 🎭 What is this?

This is a demonstration of how one might build a price tracking system, if one were so inclined.

## 🎭 But why?

Back a while ago I did one of those data analysis bootcamps. Learned some proper coding skills, data viz, some statistics, machine learning, _and some web scraping_. The latter needed some proper attention, so I figured I'd use it for good.

## 🎭 For the greater good?
Absolutely, man. Namely: to track prices of products one might be interested in. Say.. A VR headset? Or a sofa. But these pesky retailers want to extort every single dime from my hard-earned salary. And I don't want to be scammed by these greedy corporations. I mean sure, I _will_ eventually capitulate and give them my money, but it will be after I've had a chance to compare prices and find the best deal.

## 🎭 Is this like a portfolio thing?
Yes, man. Yes it is.

## 🎭 But can't CGPT make it better?
Stop it, man. Stop it. I spent so many hours learning beautiful soup and selenium, and you're going to tell me that it was all for nothing?

## 🎭 Maybe it was all for nothing?
Sure, maybe it was. But I learned a lot, and I had fun. So there.

# Features That Won't Make You Say "Run Away!"

- **Modular Scrapers**: Like the Knights of the Round Table, each scraper knows its quest
- **Error Handling**: More robust than said Round Table

- **Clean Code**: Not a single shrubbery in sight (except in the documentation)

## 🏗️ The Castle Aaauuuuggghhh-chitecture

Our noble quest is built upon these sacred pillars:

1. **The Scrapers**: Brave knights venturing forth to retrieve the sacred prices

## 🧠 Wisdom of the Ancient Ones

This project demonstrates more concepts than the Spanish Inquisition has... unexpected surprises:

- Web scraping that won't make you say "I'm not dead yet!"
- Object-oriented design that even the Black Knight would approve of
- Data persistence that's more reliable than a swallow's airspeed velocity
- Visualization prettier than the Castle Aaauuuuggghhh

## ⚔️ A Word of Warning, Brave Adventurer

- This is but a humble demonstration
- Always respect website terms unless you want to face the Spanish Inquisition
- We rate limit because "we are the Knights Who Say 'Ni!', not the Knights Who Say 'DDoS'"
